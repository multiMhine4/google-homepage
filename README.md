# What is this?

This is a project for The Odin Project (TOP) making a Google homepage.


# What will I have demonstrated?

At the end of this project, I would have shown basic understanding of how the different elements of a webpage work together to give a coherent style. I would have used basic design skills to position the elements to make them look nice together.
